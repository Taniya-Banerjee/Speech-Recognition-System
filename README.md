# Speech-Recognition-System
## What is speech recognition system?
A program's capacity to convert spoken language into written language is known as speech recognition, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer voice recognition, or speech-to-text. 

## How does speech recognition work?
Speech recognition in Python works with algorithms that perform linguistic and acoustic modeling. Acoustic modeling is used to recognize phenones/phonetics in our speech to get the more significant part of speech, such as words and sentences. Speech recognition starts by taking the sound energy produced by the person speaking and converting it into electrical energy with the help of a microphone. It then converts this electrical energy from analog to digital and finally to text.

## What did we do in the project
In the project, we define the path of the browser we want to launch (in our case Firefix) and we convert the spoken audio to text. The text is then launched in the browser and takes us to the website.
